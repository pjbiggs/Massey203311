## Contact

My office is located in the Hopkirk Research Institute on the Manawatu campus.  This is a _**restricted access building**_, and so visiting my office will have to be by prior arrangement.  I am happy to discuss any aspects of the course work, _**please email me beforehand so we can arrange to meet**_.
